# pyt-audio

I often grab vocal samples from YouTube videos to put into music, and always end up at some sketchy, adware-ridden website to do so and never the same one twice. Since it's relatively trivial to make one of these for myself, I finally just made a Python app to rip these for myself and simplify this process.

It saves to the "Downloads" folder, should be OS independent.
